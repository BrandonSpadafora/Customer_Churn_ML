# Customer_Churn_ML

This is an Machine learning model to predict customer churn(how often they leave)

## Description

Customers come and go, but you want to know wether more come than go and how long they stay
for. This ML model's goal is to figure out the statistics of it and even try to predict customer churn.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* You're going to want to set up a new enviroment for this(you don't have to though!)
* import numpy as np
* import pandas as pd
* import sklearn
* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* import seaborn as sns
* from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
* from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
* from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
* from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
* from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

### Installing

make sure to have the csv dataset and the ipynb in the same 
folder(or have both on your desktop)
